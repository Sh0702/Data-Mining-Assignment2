CSE 572 - Data Mining HW2

1. Preprocessed the Titanic Dataset
2. Learn and fine-tuned a decision tree model and,plotted the decision tree
3. Applied the five-fold cross validation of your fine-tuned decision tree learning model to the Titanic training data to extract average classification accuracy.
4. Applied the five-fold cross validation of your fine-tuned random forest learning model to the Titanic training data to extract average classification accuracy.
5) Concluded on which algorithm is better, DecisionTree or RandomForest
